### **Education Project / Field Work — Reading Interventions, Accessibility Education, Child-Centred Pedagogy & Community Engagement**  
*Pune, Delhi & Sonipat — 2013–Present*

According to the **Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)**, India continues to face significant foundational literacy challenges: a large proportion of Grade 3 students are unable to read a Grade 1-level text, and learning gaps remain persistent across government and low-income schools.

## **Teach For India Classroom Interventions (2025–Present)**  
Since **May 2025**, I have been engaging with [**Teach For India (TFI)**](https://www.teachforindia.org/) classrooms across **Pune and New Delhi**, designing and testing creative interventions aimed at **reducing reading-level gaps**. This work integrates both community engagement and classroom support.

My ongoing project focuses on:

- Integrating **theatre**, **[storytelling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lEVCYfDAiSvtQ_95nH4NuuWqEFUmdLZw/view?usp=drive_link)**, and **[comic strips](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-cy8kCQoiK61WgRzj_C5KxQ1WL0NQEqP/view?usp=drive_link)** to make reading joyful and accessible for early learners.  
- Applying **KFI-inspired pedagogical methods** (Krishnamurti Foundation of India), centred on observation, intrinsic motivation, and learning without fear.  
  **[View KFI Certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gr4MSYstletHcD7_9p-CiIu0zMA3BmrK/view?usp=sharing)**  
- Working closely with teachers, school leaders, and parents to **mitigate corporal punishment** and strengthen psychosocial safety in classrooms.  
- Conducting detailed assessments, literacy diagnostics, and field observations to support evidence-based instructional strategies.

## **Accessibility & Inclusive Education Work (2019–2023)**  
From **2019 to 2023**, I volunteered at Ashoka University to support students with visual impairments, contributing to the university’s accessibility ecosystem.  
Key work includes:

- **Teaching basics of coding** to visually impaired peers using screen-readers and audio-guided workflows.  
- **Teaching cycling by tracing sound**, helping students navigate safely using auditory cues.  
- Supporting classroom inclusion, accessible technology use, and confidence-building through peer-led teaching.

## **Theatre-Based Teaching (Swechha NGO — 2013)**  
In **2013**, I taught theatre as part of **Swechha NGO**’s production of **[“The Lorax”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_KHK8bSBUo)**, working with children from under-resourced communities.  
The project introduced environmental themes through performance, movement, and creative expression, helping children explore ideas through embodied learning.

## **Professional Development**  
I participated in the <span style="color:#2558b3; font-weight:bold;">[British Council Workshop – “Three Practical Ideas to Use Assessment in Your Classroom”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQglC1_nSgVJuno8a69Rdy3-Cdkctuxc/view?usp=sharing)</span> on **24 September 2025**, which strengthened my understanding of formative assessment and evidence-based evaluation practices.

This project remains **ongoing**, with continued documentation and evaluation.
